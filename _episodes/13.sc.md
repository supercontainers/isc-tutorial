title: "Deploy containers on a supercomputer"
teaching: 15
exercises: 20
questions:
- How can I execute commands in a container with Singularity or Shifter?
- How are variables and directories shared between host and container?
objectives:
- Download and run containers on a supercomputer
- Manage sharing of variables and directories with the host
- Run a real-world bioinformatics application in a container
keypoints:
- Download a container image with `singularity pull` or `shifterimg pull`
- Execute commands in a container with `singularity exec` or `shifter`
- By default Singularity and Shifter pass all host variables to the container
- By default Singularity uses the host current directory as the container working directory, whereas Shifter gives precedence to `WORKDIR` from the Dockerfile
- Define container specific shell variables with Singularity by prefixing them with `SINGULARITYENV_`
- Mount additional host directories with Singularity with the flag `-B`, or the variable `SINGULARITY_BINDPATH`

### Download and run containers

Before starting, let us cd into the `exercises` subdirectory of the tutorial repository directory (see also Setup page):

```bash
cd ~/isc-tutorial/exercises
```


#### Singularity

Download an old Ubuntu image using:

```bash
singularity pull docker://ubuntu:18.04
```
```output

INFO:    Creating SIF file...
INFO:    Build complete: ubuntu_18.04.sif
```

Note how you need to prepend `docker://` to the image name, to tell Singularity you're downloading an image in Docker format (the default would be to download a SIF image).

The image file is just in your current directory:

```bash
ls
```
```output
ubuntu_18.04.sif
```

Now let's execute some Linux commands from within the container, `whoami` and `cat /etc/os-release`:

```bash
singularity exec ubuntu_18.04.sif whoami
```
```output
tutorial
```

```bash
singularity exec ubuntu_18.04.sif cat /etc/os-release
```
```output

PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
VERSION_CODENAME=bionic
UBUNTU_CODENAME=bionic
```

Note how with Singularity the user in the container is the same as in the host machine.

Singularity has a dedicated syntax to open an interactive shell prompt in a container:

```bash
singularity shell ubuntu_18.04.sif
```
```output
Singularity>
```

Exit the shell by typing `exit` or hitting `Ctrl-D`.

Finally, note you can request Singularity to execute a container straight away, if the image is not available locally it will be pulled under the hood, and stored in the Singularity cache:

```bash
singularity exec docker://ubuntu:16.04 cat /etc/os-release
```
```output

```

By default, the cache is stored in `~/.singularity`; this location can be customised using the environment variable `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`.  
A subcommand, `singularity cache`, can be used to manage the cache.


#### Shifter

Let's download the same Ubuntu image as above, using `shifterimg`:

```bash
shifterimg pull ubuntu:18.04
```
```output
2020-11-02T22:38:46 Pulling Image: docker:ubuntu:18.04, status: READY
```

Locally stored images are managed by Shifter itself:

```bash
shifterimg images
```
```output
mycluster  docker     READY    0e855866b8   2020-11-02T22:38:46 ubuntu:18.04                  
```

What's the container user with Shifter?  Let's use both `id -u` and `whoami`:

```bash
shifter --image=ubuntu:18.04 whoami
```
```output
tutorial
```

```bash
shifter --image=ubuntu:18.04 id -u
```
```output
1001
```

Again, these come from the host.

You can try more Linux commands:

```bash
shifter --image=ubuntu:18.04 cat /etc/os-release
```
```output
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="18.04.5 LTS (Bionic Beaver)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS"
VERSION_ID="18.04"
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
VERSION_CODENAME=bionic
UBUNTU_CODENAME=bionic
```

NOTE: If you need to open an interactive shell in the container with Shifter, just execute `bash` in the container.


### Share host environment variables

By default, host variables are shared with the container:

```bash
export HELLO="world"
```

You can access that variable both with Singularity:

```bash
singularity exec ubuntu_18.04.sif bash -c 'echo $HELLO'
```
```output
world
```

and with Shifter:

```bash
shifter --image=ubuntu:18.04 bash -c 'echo $HELLO'
```
```output
world
```

There are some additional user options worth discussing, for further tuning of the shell environment.  In some cases, *e.g.* when using Python containers, you might need to isolate the container shell from the host.  To this end, use `-e` with Singularity:

```bash
singularity exec -e ubuntu_18.04.sif bash -c 'echo $HELLO'
```
```output

```

and `-E` with Shifter:

```bash
shifter -E --image=ubuntu:18.04 bash -c 'echo $HELLO'
```
```output

```

If you need to pass variables to the container in this situation, you can use a dedicated syntax.  With Singularity it looks like:

```bash
export SINGULARITYENV_BYE="moon"
singularity exec -e ubuntu_18.04.sif bash -c 'echo $BYE'
```
```output
moon
```

or, from version `3.6.x` on:

```bash
singularity exec -e --env BYE="moon" ubuntu_18.04.sif bash -c 'echo $BYE'
```
```output
moon
```

And with Shifter:

```bash
shifter -E --env BYE="moon" --image=ubuntu:18.04 bash -c 'echo $BYE'
```
```output
moon
```


#### What about Podman?

By default and similar to Docker, Podman isolates host and container shell environments:

```bash
export HELLO="world"
podman run ubuntu:18.04 bash -c 'echo $HELLO'
```
```output

```

You can pass specific variables to the container by using the flag `-e`:

```bash
podman run -e HELLO ubuntu:18.04 bash -c 'echo $HELLO'
```
```output
world
```

Or even redefine variables, with the same flag:

```bash
podman run -e HELLO=moon ubuntu:18.04 bash -c 'echo $HELLO'
```
```output
moon
```


### Use host directories

Regarding the default working directory, the two container engines have different behaviours.  Let's see this with an example, the container image `marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04`, which has with a custom `WORKDIR` in the Dockerfile:

```source
FROM ubuntu:18.04

WORKDIR "/workdir"
```

How does Singularity behave?

```bash
singularity exec docker://marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04 pwd
```
```output
/home/tutorial/isc-tutorial/exercises
```

Singularity always uses the host current working directory.  

Now, how about Shifter?

```bash
shifterimg pull marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04
shifter --image=marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04 pwd
```
```output
/workdir
```

```bash
shifter --image=ubuntu:18.04 pwd
```
```output
/home/tutorial/isc-tutorial/exercises
```

Shifter follows `WORKDIR` as defined in the Dockerfile.  If undefined, it then defaults to the host current directory.

As a consequence, if you want to be sure you're running in the host current directory, you need to amend the runtime command:

```bash
shifter --workdir=$(pwd) --image=marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04 pwd
```
```output
/home/tutorial/isc-tutorial/exercises
```

With both Singularity and Shifter, the container filesystem is read-only, so if you want to write output files you must do it in a bind-mounted host directory.  
Typically, HPC administrators will configure the container engine for you, so that host filesystems containing data and software are mounted by default.

In the unlikely scenario where you need to bind-mount additional paths, Singularity offers handy methods for users.  For instance:

```bash
singularity exec ubuntu_18.04.sif ls /data2
```
```output
ls: cannot access /data2: No such file or directory
```

```bash
singularity exec -B /data2 ubuntu_18.04.sif ls /data2
```
```output
file2
```

or 

```bash
export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/data2"
singularity exec ubuntu_18.04.sif ls /data2
```
```output
file2
```


#### What about Podman?

```bash
podman run marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04 pwd
```
```output
/workdir
```

```bash
podman run ubuntu:18.04 pwd
```
```output
/
```

Similar to Docker, Podman follows `WORKDIR` as defined in the Dockerfile;  if undefined it defaults to the root dir `/`.

Also remember that, similar to Docker, Podman does not mount any host directories (although the system administrators may enable default mounting of relevant directories):

```bash
podman run -w $(pwd) marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04 pwd
```
```output
Error: workdir "/home/tutorial/isc-tutorial/exercises" does not exist on container d42af9a0aaed56b840b5a6be3aa0e2ba19114ead456036573491e54816e185ab
```

So, if you want to run the container in the host current directory, you need to use `-w` to specify the work directory, and `-v` to mount the desired host directory:

```bash
podman run -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) marcodelapierre/ubuntu_workdir:18.04 pwd
```
```output
/home/tutorial/isc-tutorial/exercises
```


### Do It Yourself: BLAST example

Now you're going to run a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) example with a container from [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro).  
BLAST is a tool bioinformaticians use to compare a sample genetic sequence to a database of known sequences; it's one of the most widely used bioinformatics packages.  
This example is adapted from the [BioContainers documentation](http://biocontainers-edu.biocontainers.pro/en/latest/running_example.html).

For this exercise, use Singularity.  
Try and achieve what you're asked to do, use the solution only if you're lost.

Before you start, change directory to `blast`:

```bash
cd ~/isc-tutorial/exercises/blast
```

> ## Pull the image
> 
> First, download the following container image:
> 
> ```
> quay.io/biocontainers/blast:2.9.0--pl526h3066fca_4
> ```
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > ```bash
> > singularity pull docker://quay.io/biocontainers/blast:2.9.0--pl526h3066fca_4
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


> ## Run a test command
>
> Now, run a simple command using that image, for instance `blastp -help`, to verify that it actually works.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```bash
> > $ singularity exec blast_2.9.0--pl526h3066fca_4.sif blastp -help
> > ```
> >
> > ```output
> > USAGE
> >   blastp [-h] [-help] [-import_search_strategy filename]
> >
> > [..]
> >
> >  -use_sw_tback
> >    Compute locally optimal Smith-Waterman alignments?
> >
> > ```
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


Now, the exercise directory contains a human prion FASTA sequence, `P04156.fasta` and a gzipped reference database to blast against, `zebrafish.1.protein.faa.gz`.  
First, uncompress the database (you can use host commands for this):

```bash
gunzip zebrafish.1.protein.faa.gz
```


> ## Run the analysis
>
> We need to perform two tasks:
> 1. prepare the zebrafish database with `makeblastdb`:
>   ```bash
>   makeblastdb -in zebrafish.1.protein.faa -dbtype prot
>   ```
> 2. run the alignment with `blastp`:
>   ```bash
>   blastp -query P04156.fasta -db zebrafish.1.protein.faa -out results.txt
>   ```
>
> Start from these commands and adapt them so you can run them from within a container.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```bash
> > singularity exec blast_2.9.0--pl526h3066fca_4.sif makeblastdb -in zebrafish.1.protein.faa -dbtype prot
> > ```
> >
> > ```output
> > Building a new DB, current time: 11/16/2019 19:14:43
> > New DB name:   /home/ubuntu/singularity-containers/demos/blast_db/zebrafish.1.protein.faa
> > New DB title:  zebrafish.1.protein.faa
> > Sequence type: Protein
> > Keep Linkouts: T
> > Keep MBits: T
> > Maximum file size: 1000000000B

> > ```bash
> > singularity exec blast_2.9.0--pl526h3066fca_4.sif blastp -query P04156.fasta -db zebrafish.1.protein.faa -out results.txt

> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


The final results are stored in `results.txt`:

```bash
less results.txt
```

```output
                                                                      Score     E
